# Langton's ant with JavaScipt

## Description

I have created a small JavaScript script that reproduces the rules of the Langton ant.<br />
Just to check out for myself the reason for the "highway" pattern. And it happens well from about 11000 movements.<br /> 
**Still as mysterious and astonishing! ...**

Based on [this video](https://youtu.be/qZRYGxF6D3w) of "[ScienceEtonnante](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaNlbnghtwlsGF-KzAFThqA)" YouTube channel.
